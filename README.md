# Treasure-Hunt

You will start off in a particular place.


In each place you will be told:
    Where the next available places you can go. (Some places may require an item (e.g. key) to get into).
    What items are in the place you are currently in.
    What people/enemies you can speak/fight with.


In each place you can do the following:
    Move to another place nearby
    Pick up an item
    Interact with a person/enemy


Your player will have a rucksack in which they can only hold a certain amount/weight of items.


Your game should have a storyline to it and a way of winning/losing.
    E.g. you need a key to enter a particular place (e.g. castle), once you are in the castle there is a monster. You need to have picked up an axe beforehand to defeat him else you lose.


Your game should also have a hidden way of winning.
    E.g. if you pick up 2 particular items a hidden place appears which you can enter. You are then given a puzzle to solve. If you solve the puzzle you win the secret treasure. 


These are the basic requirements. You have the option of adding/tweaking features.


You should have at least:
    10 places
    20 items 
    5 interactable people/enemies 
    5 more commands on top of move, pick up and interact.
